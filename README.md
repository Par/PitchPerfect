# PitchPerfect
The Pitch Perfect app allows users to record a sound using the device’s microphone. It then allows users to play the recorded sound back with four different sound modulations: Chipmunk, Darth Vader, Super Slow, and Super Fast.
The app has two view controller scenes.
● Record Sounds View:​Allows users to record a sound.
● Play Sounds View:​Allows users to play the recorded sound back with effects.
